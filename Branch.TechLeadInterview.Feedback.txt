Style:
Uses tables for layout which is outdated
Right font for rows, wrong font for buttons
Not responsive
Hover style on all the time for the rows

Functionality:
Entire email field shows cursor pointer, but only the email is clickable 
Edit functionality doesn't navigate back
Only the root URL works; others do not
Navigating to the edit page just loads /user-details without any URL param to identify the user, and keeps the state of which user it is locally, so if you reload the page, it breaks
